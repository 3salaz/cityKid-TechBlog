This is my first post on my new blog! It's been a long time comming,
I've spent so much time following toutorials on youtube, medium, etc.
I never felt quite confident, in my programming to vear away from the toutorial.
I'd change something, break, and get lost on youtube finding more and more challenging problems.
I felt very overwhelmed, especially with all the options out there to developing software.
